#Session 2 - Group Project - Tapt

##Overview of Project

This app is aimed at the brewery and a person who is thirsty for a beer.
It also aims at educating the general public about all the different types of beer,
as well as the functionality of being able to create your own Tour de Brewery.

###Brewery

The first aspect of this app is the ability for a brew pub owner or a bar who provides
craft beer to their consumers a dashboard for telling the general public what is currently
on tap ready for immediate consumption.  This is great for the brew pubs that constantly
change out their taps for seasonal drafts.  This is also great for the up and coming brew pubs
that don't have a website yet and want to gain more online presence.  



The ownder also has a backlog of previous beers that were once on tap and can hopefully
just be able to drag and drop what's currently on tap as well move it to the backlog.
The owner finally will be able to have the ability to let users know what seasonal beer
is about to be coming back on tap. Finally breweries will be able also to provide information
about the brewery such as description, location info, etc.

###Users

Users will be able to login and be able to rate both the brewery/establishment as wel as the specific beers on tap, backlogged,
and up and coming.  Ranking will be out of a five point scale and there will also be
reviews for both the beers and breweries.  


Users will also be able to find what beers are "hot" or "trending" as well as see all the new 
beers that have just been added by the brewery.  Further functionality for the user will be able to go to a different
page and be able to compare craft beer.  Users will also have a page for finding a beer near them
within a certain distance.   Users can filter by:

1. Distance
2. Beer Category 
3. Alcohol content
4. New and popular


The user will also have a page where they can see all of the different types
of beers -i.e. pale ale, stout, porter.  This provides a description of the beers
Finally, a user will be able to create their own Tour de Brewery. This tour includes
the ability to work with the google maps api and be able to chart out a route of breweries
for their own adventure. This will hopefully be able to share on facebook as well as twitter
so it can be shared for people who want to plan an event.
